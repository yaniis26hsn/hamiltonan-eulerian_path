THIS IS  A SUGGESTED SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM KNWON AS HAMILTONIAN PATH/CIRCUT IN A GRID  . THIS CODE RETURNS IF THERE IS A SOLUTION TO :
1. HAMILTONIAN PATH : PROVIDE THE COORDINATES OF ANY TWO POINTS , IF THERE IS PATH THAT PASSES FROM EACH NODE (OR SQUARE IF WOULD LIKE TO VISULISE AS) EXACTLY ONECE STARTING FROM ONE POINT AND GETTING TO ANOTHER IT WILL RETURN TRUE
2. HAMITONIAN CIRCUIT : PROVIDE THE CORDINATES OF ANY POINT , IF THERE IS PATH IF THERE IS PATH THAT PASSES FROM EACH NODE EXACTLY ONCES AND GET BACK TO THAT ORIGINAL POINT IT WILL RETURN A "TRUE"
3. ELSE IT WILL RETURN A FALSE VALUE
